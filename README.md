## Features

The project includes the following core functionalities:

1. **Scroll-based Header Animation**:
   - The header includes an animation that hides when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up. This improves user experience by maximizing screen space while navigating.

2. **Navigation with SEO-Friendly URLs**:
   - The header includes navigation links that reflect the corresponding pages in the URL, ensuring proper SEO practices. For example, the Favorites page is now accessible through `/favourites`.

3. **Favorites Toggle Functionality**:
   - The project now includes functionality to add and remove meetups from the user's favorites list. The state of favorites is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even after page reloads. The badge in the header dynamically updates to reflect the number of favorites in real-time, providing a seamless experience for the user.
